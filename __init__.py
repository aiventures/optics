   k: Aperture Number 
   sensor_type: sensor dimensions
   megapixels: sensor resolution
   f:focal length in mm
   dof: Depth of field
   fov: Field of view
   iso: Sensor Sensitivity
   crop: Crop Factor sensor
   lambda: Wavelength in nm
   m: (image) magnification
   t: Exposure time (in seconds)
   EV: Exposure Value
   D: Diopters of closeup lens in 1/map
   extension: extension of bellows/macro rings in mm
   alpha: Ray incident angle (relative to normal of lens surface)
